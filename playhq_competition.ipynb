    "# PlayHQ Season Competition: Team & Fixture Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the seasons available under an orgaization (e.g., Coburg Association).\n",
    "2. Find season ID from the season name, and vice-versa.\n",
    "3. Extract all teams in a season competition (and save them into a CSV file).\n",
    "4. Extract the fixtures of every team in the competition so far. If the games have been played, the result will be there too.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the data is from [PlayHQ](http://playhq.com/) via its Public [API](https://support.playhq.com/hc/en-au/sections/4405422358297-PlayHQ-APIs). Detailed reference documentation for PlayHQ API can be found [here](https://docs.playhq.com/tech).\n",

    "This notebook was first used to support the scheduler season capstone project in 2023.\n",
