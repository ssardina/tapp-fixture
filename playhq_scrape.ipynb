    "This system allows to scrape game fixtures from [PlayHQ](http://playhq.com/) via its Public [API](https://support.playhq.com/hc/en-au/sections/4405422358297-PlayHQ-APIs). It will produce a CSV file ready to be uploaded as Schedule in [TeamApp](https://brunswickmagicbasketball.teamapp.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Public* APIs only require a header parameters to get a successful response, which includes the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x-api-key` (also referred to as the Client ID) will be provided by PlayHQ when you request access to the public API via their [support page](https://support.playhq.com/hc/en-au) or email support@playhqsupport.zendesk.com. This key can be stored in a file `x_api_key.txt` or it will be asked interactively by the notebook otherwise. In many cases, the feature to create new API credentials is disabled for a user and can only be actioned by a Super Administrator role within the Play HQ portal.\n",
    "- `x-phq-tenant` usually refers to the sport/association - in this case '`bv`'.\n",
